## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Orchestrator Integration Points

```python
# ML Pipeline Event Tracking
await self.ml_pipeline.event_tracker.track_event(
    event_type="message_exchange",
    event_data={
        "conversation_id": state.conversation_id,
        "phase": state.phase,
        "emotion_detected": context_analysis.get("primary_emotion"),
        "tier_detected": state.tier_detected,
        "price_mentioned": price_mentioned
    }
)

# Pattern Recognition Integration
patterns = await self.pattern_recognition.detect_patterns(
    conversation_id=state.conversation_id,
    messages=message_dicts,
    context={
        "customer_data": state.customer_data,
        "phase": state.phase,
        "emotional_state": context_analysis.get("primary_emotion")
    }
)

# ML Pipeline Prediction Processing
pipeline_result = await self.ml_pipeline.process_conversation_predictions(
    conversation_id=state.conversation_id,
    messages=message_dicts,
    context=conversation_context,
    predictions=predictive_insights
)
```
