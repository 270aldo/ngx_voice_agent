## 📚 Usage Examples

### ML Predictions - New Consolidated API

```python
from src.services.consolidated_ml_prediction_service import ConsolidatedMLPredictionService, PredictionType

# Initialize service
ml_service = ConsolidatedMLPredictionService()
await ml_service.initialize()

# Single prediction
features = {
    "engagement_score": 0.8,
    "questions_asked": 3,
    "buying_signals": 2,
    "demo_requested": True,
    "price_discussed": True
}

result = await ml_service.predict_single(
    prediction_type=PredictionType.CONVERSION,
    features=features,
    conversation_id="conv_123"
)

print(f"Conversion Probability: {result.probability:.2%}")
print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence:.2%}")
print(f"Reasoning: {result.reasoning}")
```

### NLP Analysis - New Consolidated API

```python
from src.services.consolidated_nlp_analysis_service import ConsolidatedNLPAnalysisService

# Initialize service  
nlp_service = ConsolidatedNLPAnalysisService()
await nlp_service.initialize()

# Comprehensive analysis
text = "I'm interested in your pricing plans. Can you show me a demo?"

result = await nlp_service.analyze_text(
    text=text,
    conversation_id="conv_123"
)

print(f"Intent: {result.intent.intent.value} ({result.intent.confidence:.2%})")

    prediction_types=[PredictionType.CONVERSION, PredictionType.NEEDS],
    features_batch=[features_1, features_2, features_3]
)

results = await ml_service.predict_batch(batch_request)
# Process 3 conversations x 2 prediction types = 6 predictions in single call

# Batch NLP analysis  
texts = [
    "How much does it cost?",
    "Can you show me the features?", 
    "I need to think about it"
]

nlp_results = await nlp_service.analyze_batch(texts)
# Analyze 3 texts concurrently
```

### Compatibility Layer - Zero-Downtime Migration

```python
# Legacy interface still works unchanged
from src.services.ml_compatibility import get_conversion_prediction_service

# Automatically routes to consolidated service if feature flag enabled
conv_service = await get_conversion_prediction_service()

# Same legacy API, improved performance  
result = await conv_service.predict_conversion(
    conversation_id="conv_123",
    messages=messages,
    customer_profile=profile
)
# Returns same format as legacy service
```
