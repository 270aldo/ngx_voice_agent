# NGX Voice Sales Agent - Complete Project Roadmap to 100%

## üìä Current Status: 88% Complete

This roadmap covers ALL aspects needed to reach 100% project completion, not just ML capabilities.

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

The project has strong foundations but needs completion in several key areas:
- **ML Integration**: 12% missing (Critical - blocks core functionality)
- **Frontend/UI**: 30% missing (Admin dashboard, analytics)
- **Documentation**: 40% missing (API docs, user guides)
- **SDKs**: 50% missing (Implementation incomplete)
- **Production Readiness**: 15% missing (Scaling, monitoring gaps)

**Total Estimated Time**: 80-120 hours (2-3 weeks with full-time development)
