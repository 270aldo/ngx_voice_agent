## Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Initial Setup (Day 1)

#### Morning (9:00 - 12:00)
1. **Final Code Freeze**
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0-beta -m "Beta release"
   git push origin v1.0.0-beta
   ```

2. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   # Run migrations
   npm run migrate:production
   
   # Verify tables
   npm run db:verify
   ```

3. **Deploy API Servers**
   ```bash
   # Deploy to primary region
   ./scripts/deploy-production.sh us-east-1
   
   # Deploy to secondary region
   ./scripts/deploy-production.sh eu-west-1
   ```

#### Afternoon (13:00 - 17:00)
4. **Configure Load Balancer**
   - Set up health checks
   - Configure SSL termination
   - Enable sticky sessions (if needed)

5. **Enable Monitoring**
   ```bash
   # Deploy monitoring stack
   ./scripts/deploy-monitoring.sh
   
   # Verify metrics flowing
   curl https://api.ngx.com/metrics
   ```

6. **Smoke Tests**
   ```bash
   # Run production smoke tests
   npm run test:production:smoke
   ```

### Phase 2: Gradual Rollout (Day 2-7)

     -d '{"beta_access": {"enabled": true, "percentage": 10}}'
   ```

2. **Monitor metrics**
   - Response times
   - Error rates
   - Conversion rates

#### Day 3-4: 25% Traffic
1. **Increase traffic allocation**
2. **A/B test analysis**
3. **Performance tuning**

#### Day 5-6: 50% Traffic
1. **Load testing at scale**
2. **Database optimization**
3. **Cache warming**

#### Day 7: 100% Traffic
1. **Full beta launch**
2. **Remove feature flags**
3. **Announce to users**

## Rollback Plan

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Error rate > 1%
- P95 latency > 500ms
- Uptime < 99.5%
- Conversion rate drop > 20%

### Manual Rollback Steps
1. **Immediate Actions** (< 5 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Switch to previous version
   ./scripts/rollback.sh v0.9.0
   
   # Verify rollback
