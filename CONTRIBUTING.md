   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clean, documented code
   - Follow existing patterns and conventions
   - Add tests for new functionality

3. **Run tests locally**
   ```bash

### Pull Request Process

1. **Before submitting:**
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Update documentation if needed
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Verify no security issues

2. **PR Requirements:**
   - Fill out the PR template completely
   - Link related issues
   - Ensure CI checks pass
   - Request reviews from maintainers

3. **Review Process:**
   - Address reviewer feedback
   - Keep PR scope focused
   - Maintain clean commit history

### Code Style Guidelines

#### Python
- Follow PEP 8
- Use Black for formatting (configured in pre-commit)
- Maximum line length: 88 characters
- Use type hints for all functions

```python
def calculate_score(
    user_input: str,
    context: Dict[str, Any],
    threshold: float = 0.8
) -> float:
    """Calculate relevance score for user input.
    
    Args:
        user_input: The user's message
        context: Current conversation context
        threshold: Minimum score threshold
        
    Returns:
        Relevance score between 0 and 1
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

#### Documentation
- Write clear docstrings for all public functions
- Keep README and other docs up to date
- Include examples where helpful

### Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

```python
def test_calculate_score_with_valid_input():
    # Arrange
    user_input = "I need help with pricing"
    context = {"topic": "sales"}
    
    # Act
    score = calculate_score(user_input, context)
    
    # Assert
    assert 0 <= score <= 1
    assert score > 0.5  # Should be relevant
```
